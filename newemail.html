July 28th 2022 - Last updated 11:02 PM CST<br>
With the coached perforance audit of the CEOs now ended on July 29th; as summary, so answer what the lessons learned and performances shown by Amazon CEOs, Amazon Executives of departments of organized incorporation, and Amazon ERC of Amazon legal for pursuit of union only in interests of the  Board of Directors?
This below, message received on July 28 of 5:59 PM CST, is the epitomy of progress since the date of initial audit, under 
 the framing context, from of the free market in both the public sector and private SECTOR
(due to Amazon Legal's mess of motions executed in May), since the start date June 4th, through the performance improvement plan initation.

<p style="font-family: vox;">
  And so, sent from Amazon Development Center <b>U.S.</b>, Inc., (Notice the clear stating of U.S., Inc), 
  from a support staff overworked and underpaid in India, 
  not the U.S., 
  since a record of sending emails at mostly 2-9 AM PST ERC, 
  the HR Partner/Entity of Amazon Services LLC, On Record, with notice of Audit give to operational chiefs 
  of Amazon with full liability of non-compliant operations held: Adam Selipsky and Andy Jassy,  and the 
  two CEOs, (NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO ADULT MALE GEN X CEO FULL SIZED) notice of violation of book keeping in 
  non-compliant destruction of employee records against the policies of Federal Acts AND Labour Laws of the People's Republic of China,
  just as a business excersize in cross-domestic adherance for a multi-national corporation,
  <ul>
    <li>
      THE APEX CULMINATION OF PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN ORGANIZATIONAL FUNCTION, IS 
      FULL WILLFUL IGNORANCE OF RECORDS OF ONE EMPLOYEE,
      NOW RECORDED IN AUDIT. GIVEN THE BLATANT STATEMENT 
      OF NOT IMPLICIT, BUT NOW EXPLICIT, LEGAL FRAUD,

    </li>
    <ul>
      <cite>"THE AND YEAR YOU ENDED YOUR EMPLOYMENT WITH AMAZON"</cite>
      <li>
        Such a statement is legal fraud given just one, out of the countless 
        evidence of violation: attempt(s) of termination for 
        an employee that was/is on medical leave AND FMLA,
        DURING the dates of which THE FRAUDULENT termination MOTIONS
        were executed, on MAY 6TH, AND MAY 7TH, AND 
        JUNE 7TH, AND IT WAS THROUGH ZIPING LIU CORPORATION 
        NON PROFIT ALIGNED OF FEDERAL ENTITY,
        THAT AFTER THE VIOLATION OF GROSS NEGLICENCE 
        BY AMAZON IN TURNING OFF ZIPING LIU'S LIFE ON MAYTH 30TH,
        ON JUNE 11TH, HEALTH WAS RESTORED BY AETNA,
        AND ON JULY 28TH, 
        WITH HEALTH AETNA RESTORED UNDER AMAZON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
        EMPLOYER PARTNERSHIP,
        AMAZON DEVELOPMENT CENTER, FOR AMAZON ERC,
        STILL ON RECORD HAS SHOWCASED NON-CORRECTIVE
        ACTION IN BLATANT EVIDENCE OF EMPLOYEE DESTRUCTION 
        OF MEDICAL RECORDS WITHIN AMAZON DLS OF AMAZON ERC.
      </li>
      
    </ul>
  </ul>
</p>

      <div>
        As a reminder to all HR Orgs taking note of this case study of the
        decade from Jeff Bezos bookstore which in because Amazon Legal is guilty
        of this: Do not ever think you are above the law, so much so that you
        began to think you&nbsp;can then use law enforcement from the public
        sector to motion out policies that stand no actual grounding, and
        moreso, you actually made the FBI believe the shit you said about me.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        Because when they came and talked to me at my house, they realized how
        fucking stupid the entire situation was.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        And they even said it themselves, "The FBI doesn't just go and
        investigate issues of someone's pay."
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        And I gave them a look, and they gave me the look, and they knew, I
        knew.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        The FBI shouldn't be investigating some Amazon Executie calling them
        about me either.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        Although, you made up a bunch of lies to the FBI, and made them think I
        was some dangerous bone to society.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        The FBI knows who I am, so it didn't take long for them to realize how
        fucking dumb it was.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        And that's not the first time, they came right after sending this
        letter:
        <a
          href="https://adamselipsky.cn"
          target="_blank"
          data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adamselipsky.cn&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1659051597167000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jkakl7hMJeYsY89FjAOWR"
          >https://adamselipsky.cn</a
        >. They came by proxy via police LJ PD, May 8th, because out of
        desperation&nbsp;Amazon Legal realized their tactic of using an ethics
        hotline as reasons for termination was invalid.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        But Then&nbsp;they decided to get rid of the involuntary motion as well,
        and so on June 4th, 2022,
        <a
          href="http://thefbi.us/junefourth"
          target="_blank"

          >thefbi.us/junefourth</a
        >, you referenced this&nbsp; voided and fraud of legal agenda, from May
        6th, instead of May 7th, because it is a logical tautology&nbsp;of
        twisting.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        You see, you AMAZON LEGAL idiots just love making logical gateways for
        you to just entrap people in don't you
      </div>
      <div>
        Because you entrapped yourself. Your own non-invention agreement&nbsp;is
        clearly violated by you, for motioning&nbsp;out any of these&nbsp;voided
        termination&nbsp;documents, policy numbers: 3.2, and 4.3.&nbsp;
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        You do realize, just because you are a director, executive, or legal,
        doesn't mean you are exempt from policies of your own organization.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        But you didn't just do that, you actually had the audacity to believe
        you are, AND STILL ARE, exempt from Federal policies and law.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL,</div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>
        YOU USED THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO ENFORCE FALSE AND FRAUDULENT MOTIONS OF
        YOUR BY LAWS.
      </div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div><br /></div>
      <div>

            <li>
              So then you told the FBI hey this kid is crazy, he's writing crazy
              shit.
            </li>
            <li>SO then they came and visited me twice.</li>
            <li>
              The FBI and police told me "YOU GOTTA STOP DOING WHAT YOU'RE
              DOING,"
            </li>
            <li>
              I said, what the fuck am I doing? I'm on medical leave.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Both times they came.</li>
            <li>
              Obviously it was about the writings online, because you got scared
              about using my words.
            </li>
            <li>
              You got even more scared when you realized how self incriminating
              the non-invention "involuntary" addition to the fraud terms would
              be.
            </li>
            <li>
              You wanted to black me out so fast, you added an addendum of
              involuntary to get the job done, in your words, you stated in the
              numerous bullshit emails you sent me, "If you don't sign your
              termination agreement your employment will reach an unknownable
              state."
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You copied my words again, but I knew what you meant. YOu were
                going to figure out a&nbsp; loophole to blackme out of my work
                laptops one way or another regardless of standings of any ground
                or rule of law.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>
            What am I getting at? A look back to April, 2022. Since ERC is very
            confusing.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            So basically, you motioned out procedures without reason and
            without&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;towards any type of real policy or
            framework or framing, because your own personal wants and needs were
            above the interests of the society and the free market.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            So right now, this is the outcome. You just walk around clueless and
            actionless. It's fine, I guess I need to make things&nbsp;more clear
            than. I'm almost done with the prologue.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Andy Jassy, you better step up and get my shit actioned because,
            what the fuck are you even thinking with trying to use a
            non-invention aggreement to agendize an involuntary move intended as
            a blackout? You get this mess. And you end up changing my life
            forever.
          </li>
          <li>
            So you better understand, you came at me, and you changed everything
            for my world, by trying to shut my world down and away.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          So, cut it out. GET MY CONCERNS HANDLED. I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY RIGHT
          NOW, BECAUSE I AM LITERALLY DEALING WITH YOU LEADERS AT AMAZON THAT
          ARE SO BELOW MY UNDERSTANDING&nbsp;AND KNOWLEDGE OF ANY TYPE OF
          BUSINESS CONCEPT. THIS IS A COMPLETE DISGRACE, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO
          DEAL WITH TINY LITTLE ANTS MY WHOLE LIFE. GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY
          BEFORE I STAND UP, AND WALK OUT OF THIS CAVE AND SEAL YOU IN.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Let me make this clear to you, you have no right to come into my
            life, and change it forever, by making these idiocy decisions of
            making by you. and then term it as through the erc:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Being unable to ascertain the actual concern</li>
            <li>Having too much irrelevant information</li>
            <li>We cannot locate your case ID</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <div>
          You need to stop that and get stuff done. I'm going to move and send
          out the finished prologue of 7 of 5. Look at the numbers we have gone
          through. ANd look at all of what you have&nbsp;done Andy Jassy and
          COmpany. I suggest you improve your performance because you are being
          outclassed by a single person right.
